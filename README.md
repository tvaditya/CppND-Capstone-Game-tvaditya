# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. In this case the build direcotory already exists so delete it and the get back to step 2. Once done move to step 4.
4. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
5. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## What the project has according to rubric
1. This README file with instructions on how to run it
2. The README indicates that I chose the SnakeGame and enhanced it with obstacles
3. You can run it with cmake and make
4. We have the class structure as well.
5. It uses functions check Snake.cpp
6. It uses loops check per example Wall.cpp 
7. It reads data from a file which is in the configFiles folder you can see it game.cpp line 17
8. It uses Object Orientation with classes and headers ( checl all .cpp folders)
9. Within the .cpp and .h  files you can see speicifiers for class members
10. Within the same files you can see member initializaton lists
11. Within some classes you can see abstract implementation details from their interfaces 
12. Within classes you can see encapsulated behaviour
13. The slowers and obstacles are shared pointers
14. Classes use move semnatics whereever is possible
